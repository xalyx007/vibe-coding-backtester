Introduction
============

Overview
--------

The Modular Backtesting System is a Python framework designed for backtesting trading strategies. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture that allows users to implement and test their own trading strategies, data sources, and portfolio management techniques.

The system is built with modularity in mind, allowing components to be easily swapped out or extended. This makes it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from simple strategy testing to complex multi-strategy ensembles.

Key Concepts
-----------

Data Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data sources provide market data to the backtesting system. They are responsible for loading, preprocessing, and serving data to the strategy and portfolio manager components. The system supports various data sources, including CSV files, databases, and API connections.

Strategies
~~~~~~~~~

Strategies are the core of the backtesting system. They analyze market data and generate trading signals. The system provides a flexible interface for implementing strategies, allowing users to implement anything from simple technical indicators to complex machine learning models.

Portfolio Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Portfolio managers are responsible for converting strategy signals into actual trades, managing positions, and tracking portfolio performance. They handle position sizing, risk management, and trade execution simulation.

Event System
~~~~~~~~~~~

The backtesting system uses an event-driven architecture to simulate market events and strategy responses. This allows for realistic simulation of market conditions and strategy behavior.

Results Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system provides comprehensive tools for analyzing backtest results, including performance metrics, drawdown analysis, and visualization tools.

Use Cases
--------

The Modular Backtesting System is suitable for a wide range of use cases, including:

* Testing and validating trading strategies
* Optimizing strategy parameters
* Comparing multiple strategies
* Developing and testing portfolio management techniques
* Analyzing strategy performance under different market conditions
* Educational purposes for learning about trading and investment strategies
