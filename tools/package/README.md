# Package Files

This directory contains copies of package-related files for the project. The original files remain in the root directory for functionality, but are copied here for organization and reference.

## Files

- `MANIFEST.in`: Specifies additional files to include in the package
- `setup.py`: Package setup script
- `pyproject.toml`: Python project configuration (PEP 518)
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Usage

These files are for reference only. The actual package files used by the project are in the root directory. If you need to modify a package file, update the file in the root directory and then copy it here for reference.
