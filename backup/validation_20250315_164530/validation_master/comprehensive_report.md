## Recommendations

Some validation tests have failed. Here are recommendations for addressing the issues:

- **Basic Validation Issues**: Review the basic validation results to identify specific tests that failed. These often point to fundamental issues in the backtester implementation.
- **Cross-Validation Issues**: The discrepancies between our backtester and Backtrader indicate potential issues in trade execution, position sizing, or performance calculation. Review the detailed comparison to identify specific areas of difference.
- **Monte Carlo Validation Issues**: The Monte Carlo simulations may have revealed instability or sensitivity to small data variations. Review the distribution of results to identify potential robustness issues.

## Conclusion

The backtester has failed some validation tests and requires attention before it can be considered fully reliable. Address the issues identified in the detailed reports and rerun the validation process.
